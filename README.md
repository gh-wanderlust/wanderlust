# Wanderlust

Visit us at: https://gh-wanderlust.now.sh/

### Wanderlust is a web app where individuals can book rentals with other travelers.

As a user, I can browse rentals, look at an individual one, and mark that I‚Äôm interested in it. If enough people are interested in the same lodging at the same time, the app will connect us so we can book the trip together. I can also specify traveling preferences and find other people with similar preferences.
